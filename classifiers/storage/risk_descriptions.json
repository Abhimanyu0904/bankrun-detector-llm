    "risk": "A liquidity crisis refers to challenges in meeting short-term financial obligations due to a shortage of liquid assets. One cause of a liquidity crisis is cash flow problems, where there is not enough cash or accessible assets to cover immediate financial needs. Entities facing liquidity crises might struggle with borrowing difficulties, having limited access to credit or facing high interest rates. In severe cases, a liquidity crisis might lead to the forced liquidation of assets, often at a loss, to quickly generate necessary cash."
